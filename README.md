## OrbiSat Secondary Mission Test Files
These python files are able to determine the resonant frequency (the most prominent frequency) of an audio file, and also plot the amplitudes according to the frequencies of the audio. 
Also, we can split the files into 1 second audio files (or more) with splitaudiofile.py.
